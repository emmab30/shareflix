I'm Adib Abuslaiman, the creator of Shareflix. I developed this extension as a learning project to deepen my understanding of the WebRTC protocol. For more information, you can visit [my website here](https://adibus.dev).

## Demo

## Overview

Shareflix is a platform that allows you to watch Netflix with your friends remotely. The project includes a backend built with Express and a frontend for a Chrome extension client using React JS. Shareflix uses WebRTC for participant communication.

## Features

1. Camera activation feature.
2. User-controlled camera adjustment, allowing each camera view to be resized and repositioned.
3. Microphone activation.
4. Individual participant volume control.
5. Voice detection highlights the speaking userâ€™s name in yellow (only if their microphone is active).

## Installation

### Frontend (Chrome Extension)

Navigate to the `extension` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
npm run build   # Compiles the project
npm run watch   # Watches for file changes
npm run dev     # Sets up a development environment
```

### Backend (Server)

Navigate to the `server` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
npm run build   # Builds the server
npm run start   # Starts the server
```

Go to `shared/constants.js` file and set backend URL in `module.exports.WS_URL` (ex: 127.0.0.1:3011)

## Usage

When you access a series or movie on Netflix with the extension enabled, it automatically opens a screen with a 6-digit access code. This code can be shared with up to 4 people to watch a movie together!

Once the backend is set up and npm run build is executed for the frontend:

-   Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
-   Click on 'Load unpacked'
-   Select the `build/` folder
